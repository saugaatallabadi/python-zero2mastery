# Class Notes:

## Section 2
- Python usually uses Interpreter (goes line by line), not compiler (they take entire code and turns to machine code).
- cpython is Interpreter. Creates bytecode (`LOAD_GLOBAL` etc). Uses cypython VM to convert to 0s and 1s.
- Python is slower than C, C#, Java, but good at programmer productivity.

## Section 3
- 4 things to learn any language
    - Terms
    - Data Types
    - Actions
    - Best Practices
- Fundamental Data types: (a value in Python)
    - ` int, float, bool, str, list, tuple, set, dict `
- Classes (custom types)
    - `Supercar`
- Specialized Data Types (Special packages and modules)
- None (i.e. nothing - absence of value)
